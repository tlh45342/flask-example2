# INTRODUCTION

flask-example2 is a simple example flask app that implements authentication.  This is not designed to be pretty, or clever. This is simply designed TO WORK.  There are a lot of Flask examples out there that either are incomplete or are online tutorials that could not have ever been independently checked as they are missing critical pieces (glue, code, whatever).  Then there are long drawn-out blogs (for which I am thankful for) but where the "magic" of the developing intermediate steps per stage are missing.  Hence:  There is a flask-example2 as a seperate which adopts additional complexity and is designed to look more like a portal / application. 

Work will have been done to test this on Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, Apple Mac OS x.

- learning Flask.
- kicking off your a new project.

## INSTALLATION

The small section will discuss how just to simply run the app.  Most notably this app does not use SSL (I did say this was simple right?)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tlh45342/flask-example2.git
```

To make sure you have all the python modules installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## SIDEBAR: Notes for creating a service for Linux based distributions

I am putting my notes here now - because I will use them.  Consider these random notes used to implement the Flask APP as a service.

To create a service entry cd /etc/systemd/system
Create a file that looks something like is found in the following block.
As much as I hate assumptions - you will need to edit this to your tastes and for your environment.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=flask-example2

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/mnt/python/flask-example2/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 4 server:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The key commands for reference are: 

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start flask1.service
sudo systemctl restart flask1.service
sudo systemctl stop flask1.service
```
